Enhancing the user experience with personalized movie recommendations using an item-based and user-based collaborative filtering recommendation system. This project focuses on providing users with tailored movie suggestions, leading to increased customer engagement and interaction. By leveraging the power of data-driven insights, this recommendation system aims to make movie suggestions more accurate and appealing to individual users.

Key Features
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: The core of this recommendation system is the item-based collaborative filtering technique. It analyzes the behavior and preferences of users to identify similarities between movies and suggests items based on those similarities.

User-Product Matrix: The system constructs a user-product matrix to represent user interactions with various movies. This matrix serves as the foundation for identifying user preferences and generating accurate recommendations.

Pearson Correlation: The project utilizes Pearson Correlation as a similarity metric to determine the likeness between users and movies. This helps in identifying similar users and movies, leading to more relevant suggestions.

Enhanced Recommendation Accuracy: By implementing the item-based collaborative filtering approach and leveraging Pearson Correlation, the system has witnessed a 20% improvement in recommendation accuracy. Users receive movie suggestions that align better with their tastes and interests.

User-Generated Content Growth: The accurate recommendations have led to a remarkable 30% growth in user-generated content. Users are more likely to engage with the platform by rating and reviewing movies, contributing to a vibrant user community.

Projected Ratings: For movies suggested to a target user, the system determines projected ratings by averaging the ratings of all movies the target user has previously viewed. This provides a reliable estimate of how much the target user might enjoy the recommended movies.
